        <p class="lead mb-4">Though I am newly a college student, throughout high school I have been in the constant search for new opportunities to learn and gain experience for my future career. In my high school specifically, I was always active in clubs and organizations. I was a member of the Japanese Club and served as an officer for 2 years in Key Club. My first year I served as a publicity chair, in charge of the marketing and social outreach, and for my second year I served as the secretary in which I handled paperwork and notes for the club. Besides that, I was also active in extracurricular sports in all four years, participating in soccer, field hockey, and gymnastics. Outside of school, I also babysat, petsat, volunteered at my church, and coached in a soccer league outside of school to teach and take care of the youth as well.<br><br>

        My first real job was at Dough Zone Dumpling House, located in the bustling center of Main Street Cupertino. I started off simply as a food runner, running orders to the table. However, throughout my 8 months with this company, I was able to work hard and move forward to try various positions such as the host, cashier, server, and to-go operator. In such a fast paced working environment and with so much to do, I gained a lot of skills from this job from handling the most hungry customers to cleaning up the mess of a little kid. After my long run with this restaurant, I chose to pursue a different part-time job simply to gain more insight on other means of work.<br><br>

        Leading to my second and current job, I am so grateful for this opportunity as I truly cherish this as a life shaping experience. My job with Jeff Duerson Staffing as a Caterer has exposed me to places and practices I would have never imagined to indulge in. With this job, I've learned tecnics in serving food and drinks, and also have advanced my public speaking through meeting so many people. Additionally, this job has taken me far and wide, from the wine country of Napa and the center of San Francisco's City Hall, to the 49er's Stadium where I was lucky enough to hear The Weekend live!
